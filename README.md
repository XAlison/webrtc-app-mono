=========================

Goal:
 - Porting WebRTC demo app (https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/source/browse/trunk/webrtc) to C# - Mono.Android (Xamarin)

Roadmap:
 - Porting WebRTC demo app to C# - Mono.Touch (Xamarin)
 - Hoping to achieve some code reuse by moving some of the code to the MVVMCross framework (although it looks like UI (platform specific) code most of it)
